# Changelog

A line should be inserted at top as you start development.
This should be updated, if relevant, just before PR.
This should receive commit ids just before each keyframe is deployed.
Until I settle on version and tag consistency I am using the commit hashes (must
be on master branch and in order).
Each bullet must lead with a verb and describe the change from a user's
perspective.
