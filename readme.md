# Resin's Hubot Monorepo

This repo is a monorepo to accumulate all of Resin's Hubot builds and modules.

This repo uses lerna to tie together dependencies, node to manage each 
package and heroku to deploy to. Along the way several lessons have been 
learnt, documented in lerna.md (yes, that document will be compiled for a 
wider audience at some point, but capturing the wisdom as it happens is my 
current priority)
